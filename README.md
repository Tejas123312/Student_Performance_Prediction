## 🚀 Features
- 📊 Collects and processes student data (attendance, grades, study hours, participation, etc.)  
- 🤖 Uses **machine learning algorithms** to identify patterns and correlations  
- 🔮 Predicts whether a student will:
  - Perform well  
  - Need improvement  
  - Be at risk of underperforming  
- 🧑‍🏫 Helps teachers provide **personalized guidance and support**  
- 📑 Generates **detailed reports and actionable recommendations** using an **agentic AI pipeline**

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries/Frameworks**:  
  - Pandas, NumPy (Data Preprocessing & Analysis)  
  - Scikit-learn (Machine Learning Models)  
  - Matplotlib, Seaborn (Data Visualization)  
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub  
- **IDE/Editor**: Jupyter Notebook / VS Code  
- **Dataset**: Historical student academic data (grades, attendance, etc.)

## ⚙️ Workflow
1. **Data Collection** → Student-related data (attendance, grades, participation, study hours).  
2. **Data Preprocessing** → Cleaning, handling missing values, normalization.  
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** → Visualizing trends & feature correlations.  
4. **Model Training & Evaluation** → ML algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Trees, etc.).  
5. **Prediction & Classification** → Categorizing students into performance groups.  
6. **Report Generation** → Insights and recommendations using AI pipeline.
